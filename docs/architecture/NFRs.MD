\n\n# Non-Functional Requirements\n\n## Scalability\n- Stateless services: Allows horizontal scaling without session affinity issues.\n- Justification: In production, traffic spikes require auto-scaling; stateful services bottleneck.\n\n## Reliability\n- Idempotency: Operations can be retried safely without duplicates.\n- Retries: Automatic for transient failures.\n- Justification: Network issues or partial failures in distributed systems; without, data corruption or lost processing.\n\n## Performance\n- <50ms p99 for quality scoring: Ensures low latency for user-facing features.\n- Justification: Slow responses lead to poor UX; p99 prevents outliers affecting SLA.\n\n## Security\n- Basic auth: JWT/OAuth for API access.\n- Encryption: At rest and in transit.\n- Justification: Protects PHI in healthcare; breaches lead to legal issues and loss of trust.\n\n
